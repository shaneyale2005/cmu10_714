    "\n",
    "The goal of this homework is to give you a quick overview of some of the concepts and ideas that you should be familiar with _prior_ to taking this course.  The assignment will require you to build a basic softmax regression algorithm, plus a simple two-layer neural network.  You will create these implementations both in native Python (using the numpy library), and (for softmax regression) in native C/C++.  The homework will also walk you through the process of submitting your assignments to our autograding system.  Along the way, we'll give some guidance as to how you might want to implement these different functions, but overall the details are up to you.  What we will say, though, is that in the Python version you should make heavy use of the linear algebra calls in numpy: trying to use explicit loops will usually make the code much slower than it should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "**We know that there is a lot of prose text in this assignment, especially in the beginning, and relatively little coding.  That being said, _please_ read carefuly through the entirety of the text in this writeup.  Doing so will describe the process and philosophy behind how we structure our assignments, and will make a huge difference in your ability to complete later assignments.**\n",
    "\n",
    "All the code development for the homeworks in 10-714 can be done in the Google Colab environment.  However, instead of making extensive use of actual code blocks within a colab notebook, most of the code you develop will be done `.py` files downloaded (automatically) to your Google Drive, and you will largely use the notebook for running shell scripts that test and submit the code to the auto-grader (or optionally for testing out snippets of code as you develop, but this is not required).  This is a somewhat non-standard usage of Colab Notebooks (typically one uses them more like interactive coding environments, with code cells directly in the notebook).  However, our rationale for using them in the way that we do is actually straightforward: in addition to being a nice cloud-based notebook environment, Colab also provides very nice access to \"standard\" cloud-based GPU systems that you can spin up quickly, which will let you develop especially some of the later (CUDA-based) code without requiring you to get access to a physical GPU, or set up the CUDA libraries yourself.  That being said, **you are welcome to do the development and submission of your code in any environment you like**, we just can't guarantee the abiltiy to support any environment other than the Colab-based one.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, **make a copy of this notebook** file by selecting \"Save a copy in Drive\" from the \"File\" menu, and then run the code block below.  This will load your Google Drive folder into the Colab notebook environment, create a `/10714/hw0` directory, and clone the HW0 public repository into this directory."

    "This code looks a bit like a unit test above, but instead of assertions there are calls to `mugrade.submit()`.  These calls each evaluate the `add` function on different inputs, then send the result to the mugrade server.  The server compares the output of your function with the correct output (which is only stored on the server, not locally, so you cannot know in advance what the correct answer is), and updates your score for the assignment accordingly.  If you are logged into the mugrade system, you can go to the \"Homework 0\" assignment to see your updated grade (clicking \"Refresh\" as necessary if you are already viewing the page).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note:** For those of you familiar with autograding systems, you might notice that mugrade works a bit differently than most.  In most autograding systems you write your code to pass local tests (if you're lucky, some classes don't even provide these), then bundle up your code and submit it to the autograding system, which will unpack and execute your code on the autograding server, running it against some (unknown, for you) test cases.  Mugrade is different: the `submit_add` function is run on _your system_ (e.g., in the Colab environment you are running), and only the _results_ of the calls are sent to the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rationale for this setup is a subtle but important one.  This class requires you to develop a fairly complex system, which runs your code on specialized hardware like GPUs, on potentially long tests that train real neural network architectures.  Being unable to debug the execution of your code on the autograding test cases poses a substantial challenge in practice, not to mention issues of server capacity and slowdowns that occur usually right at the grading deadline.  Moving computation locally means that you have a lot more insight into how your code is actually running on the autograder test cases, which is extremely valuable for debugging.  By _far_ the most common post on forums for similar courses is \"my code passes all the local tests but fails on the autograder\"; and while this situation can _still_ happen in mugrade, you can at least step through the execution of your code to see _where_ and _how_ it fails.  And because the server only needs to perform simple checks of your input against the correct outputs, the server is very simple, and you will get the feedback from the autograder immediately, even right at the submission deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _disadvantage_ of a grading system like this is that it's possible to cheat.  Because you have complete control over the local execution of your code on the autograding test cases, you could, in theory, just figure out what the correct answers should be, and return them without actually implementing the required code.  Later in this assignment, for instance, you're required to write a C++ implementation of softmax regression in addition to the initial Python one.  It would be completely possible to change the autograder to use your Python implementation, rather than the C++ one, and still pass the tests.  That being said, **please do not attempt to circumvent the autograding system in any way**.  Our goal for this system is to make it genuinely easier for your to debug and develop your code, and to make the experience more similar to the \"real\" development process, and less a matter of \"figuring out why the autograder doesn't compile your particular variant of CUDA code\".  To address this point, in addition to submitting the autograder tests, when you are finished with your submission you need to also upload a `.tar.gz` file of your `/src` directory in your solution to the mugrade system.  We trust that this will not be an issue, but if there _are_ any concerns, the TAs will always be able to validate that your code produces the results (they will also be running against standard plagiarism detection systems like MOSS).\n",

    "Now that you've written SGD for a linear classifier, let's consider the case of a simple two-layer neural network.  Specifically, for input $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, we'll consider a two-layer neural network (without bias terms) of the form\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "z = W_2^T \\mathrm{ReLU}(W_1^T x)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $W_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ and $W_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times k}$ represent the weights of the network (which has a $d$-dimensional hidden unit), and where $z \\in \\mathbb{R}^k$ represents the logits output by the network.  We again use the softmax / cross-entropy loss, meaning that we want to solve the optimization problem\n",

    "**Note:** If the details of these precise equations seem a bit cryptic to you (prior to the 9/8 lecture), don't worry too much.  These _are_ just the standard backpropagation equations for a two-layer ReLU network: the $Z_1$ term just computes the \"forward\" pass while the $G_2$ and $G_1$ terms denote the backward pass.  But the precise form of the updates can vary depending upon the notation you've used for neural networks, the precise ways you formulate the losses, if you've derived these previously in matrix form, etc.  If the notation seems like it might be familiar from when you've seen deep networks in the past, and makes more sense after the 9/8 lecture, that is more than sufficient in terms of background (after all, the whole _point_ of deep learning systems, to some extent, is that we don't need to bother with these manual calculations).  But if these entire concepts are _completely_ foreign to you, then it may be better to take a separate course on ML and neural networks prior to this course, or at least be aware that there will be substantial catch-up work to do for the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these gradients, now write the `nn_epoch()` function in the `src/simple_ml.py` file.  As with the previous question, your solution should modify the `W1` and `W2` arrays in place.  After implementing the function, run the following test.  Be sure to use matrix operations as indicated by the expresssions above to implement the function: this will be _much_ faster, and more efficient, than attempting to use loops (and it requires far less code)."

Analogous to the softmax regression case, there is a `train_nn()` function in the `simple_ml.py` file you can use to train this two-layer network via SGD with multiple epochs.  Here is code, for example, that trains a two-layer network with 400 hidden units."

    "The final question in this homework requires you to implement the same function you did in Question 4, a function that runs a single epoch of linear softmax regression.  But here, you will do so with a C++ implementation, rather than a Python one. (Strictly speaking, the actual implementation here is more like raw C, but we use C++ features to build the interface to Python using the [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io) library, which you will also use to interface between C++ and Python in later homeworks.  Although there are other alternatives, pybind11 library is relatively nice as an interface, as it is a header-only library, and allows you to implement the entire Python/C++ interface within a single C++ source library.)\n",

    "Let's unpack the arguments to this function a bit.  The function essentially mirrors that of the Python implementation, but requires passing some additional arguments because we are operating on raw pointers to the array data rather than any sort of higher-level \"matrix\" data structure.  Specifically, `X`, `y`, and `theta` are pointers to the raw data of the corresponding numpy arrays from the previous section; for 2D arrays, these are stored in C-style (row-major) format, meaning that the first row of $X$ is stored sequentially as the first bytes in `X`, then the second row, etc (this contrasts with _column major_ ordering, which stores the first _column_ of the matrirx sequentially, then the second column, etc).  We also assuming there is no padding in the data; that is, the second row begins immediately after the first row, with no additional bytes added, e.g., to align the memory to a certain boundary (all these issues will be mentioned in subsequent discussion in the course, but avoided for now). Of course, because only the raw data is passed into the function, in order to know the actual sizes of the underlying matrices, we also need to pass these sizes explicitly to the function, which is what is provided by the `m`, `n`, and `k` arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an illustration of how to access the data, note that because `X` represents a row-major, $m \\times n$ matrix, if we want to access the $(i,j)$ element of $X$ (the element in the $i$th row and the $j$th column), we would use the index\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "X[i*n + j]\n",
    "```\n",
    "i.e., because `X` is $n$ columns, and stores it's columns sequentially, we'd need to access the `X[i*n]` element to access the $i$th row; and if we want to access the $j$th element in this row, we have the expression above.  The same logic would apply to the `theta` matrix, but importantly, because `theta` is a $n \\times k$ matrix, to access it's $(i,j)$ element you would use the index\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "theta[i*k + j]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Unlike in Python, you need to be very careful when accessing memory directly like this in C++, and get very used to this kind of notation (or build additional data structures that help you access things in a more intuitive fashion, but for this assignment you should just stick to the raw indexing).\n",

    "Using all this as background, implement the `softmax_regression_epoch_cpp` to accomplish the same updates as your Python implementation did.  Note that because you are just accessing the raw data, you will need to perform all the matrix-vector products manually, rather that rely on numpy to do all the matrix operations for you (**note: do not use an external matrix library like Eigen for this assignment, but code the multiplication yourself ... it is a relatively simple one**). After you do so, you can test the implementation using the following commands."

    "As expected, the numbers match exactly our Python version, and the code is ... about 5 times slower?!  What is going on here?  Well, it turns out that the \"manual\" matrix multiplication code you probably wrote for the C++ version is extremely inefficient.  While Python itself is a slow, interpreted language, numpy itself is backed by matrix multiplications written in C (or, more likely, Fortran, believe it or not), that have been highly optmized to make use of vector operations, the cache hierarchy of different processors, and other features that are essential for efficient numerical operations.  We will cover these details much more in later lectures, and you'll even write a matrix library that can actually perform these operations relatively efficiently (at least for some special cases ... it's honestly not that easy to beat numpy in general).\n",
